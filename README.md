This is a map/document that shows the number of total arrests over a selected years. The data is then divided in terms of different tyoes of crimes,number of inidicuals who identify as female or male arrested and distinguished by race. This data is relevant because many of the people that we see on tv who commit crimes are African American men, but it is important to note the poeple who identify as Caucasian are committing the same crimes in larger amounts yet they are not making the news.
